# Machine-learning-Multi-Model-Iris-Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies the famous Iris dataset using multiple models.

## Overview

The Multimodal Iris Classifier project aims to classify the Iris dataset using various machine learning models. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community that contains information about the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of three species of iris flowers.

## More About the Project

This project explores the use of multiple machine learning models to classify the Iris dataset, which includes the following classes:

- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolour
- Iris Virginica

Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of different algorithms in handling a well-known classification problem.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multimodal-iris-classifier.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd multimodal-iris-classifier
    ```

## Usage

To run the classifier, execute the Jupyter notebook:

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open the `Multimodal Iris Classifier.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to train and evaluate the models.

## Models

The following models are implemented in this project:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Stacking Classifier

Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
